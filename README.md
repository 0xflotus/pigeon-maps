# fully-react-maps

Tired of waiting 5 seconds to include 200kb of gzipped Google Maps JavaScript code just to display a few tiles and a marker?

Welcome to the club!

This project aims to provide a performance-first React-centric map engine.

Currently implemented:

- Show tiles
- Add arbitrary overlays (markers)

Missing:

- Move the map
- Zoom in and out
